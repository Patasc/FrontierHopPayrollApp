# Frontier Simple Hop Payroll App

This is a simple tool to allow Hops to more easily do their job on the Frontier server, making tracking what worker joined when, when to next pay them, their salary, title and others trivial.

It is also capable of being a bank of all current station workers, provided it has been properly filled.

It is mostly meant to be a temporary solution i had made myself so as to make my life easier, awaiting i someday try to make it a PDA program, so don't expect much changes to this, and for it to stay barebones (hence the poor code quality).

To run it either clone the repo and run `npm start` if you have npm installed

You can also run `npm run build` to compile it to a vanilla website, and can run it by simply opening the html file.

If you do not have npm installed, or just want to run it, you can download the release build and simply open the html file contained at the root.
